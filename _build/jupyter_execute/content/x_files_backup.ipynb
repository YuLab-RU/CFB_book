Usually you want to open a file, read its contents (line by line), analyze it, and write it to another file. To work with files we need the Python `file` object. `file` objects serve as a *link to a file* residing on a disk or cloud.\n",

    "In this exercise you are going to analyze data from ChIP-seq of several transcription factors in mouse embryonic stem cells ([Chen et al. 2008, 13;133(6):1106-17, PMID 18555785](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18555785/)). Please have a look at Figure 1 and 2 of this paper. Figure 1 shows the ChIP-seq profiles for the transcription factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ChIP-seq peaks that you see represent *in vivo* binding sites of these transcription factors. In Figure 2 the authors have analyzed the DNA sequence underneath these peaks, and identified specific DNA sequences (**motifs**) for each transcription factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to analyze these sequences as well, to see which motifs you can identify. You will count **k-mers** (short sequences, e.g. 8 bases in length) in the sequences underneath the ChIP-seq peaks of a specific transcription factor, and analyze which k-mers are overrepresented.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA (or amino acid) sequence files are usually in [FASTA format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format). Before you start off using the FASTA files from the study mentioned above, work on a file called `testfile.fasta` (present in `/content/gdrive/MyDrive/CFB_files`), which is a small FASTA file. This allows you to make and test your code quicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide the Python code that allows you to read the FASTA file while ignoring the description lines containing `>`. For now it is OK to print the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extend your code with the following: For each sequence, extract all possible k-mers of length 4. Skip sequences that are shorter than 4 bases. Print the output. Make sure your code allows you to easily run the same analysis with different k-mer lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extend your code with the following: Count the number of occurrences for each k-mer that is encountered (in all sequences together).\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Now that you have assembled your code (you can remove the printing statements you used for testing) adapt your code to count kmers of **length 8**. Run your code on 2 files present in the `/content/gdrive/MyDrive/CFB_files` directory:\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Write a function called `top_kmers()`. The function should have three arguments: `fname`, `k`, `n_top`. The `fname` represents the FASTA filename, `k` the length of the k-mer and `n_top` the number of most abundant k-mers to return. The function should not print the k-mers, but return them as a list. The `k` and `n_top` arguments should be *optional*, with default values of 8 and 10, respectively."
