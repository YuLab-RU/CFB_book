    "   \n",
    "   1. Consider the 3 example `string`s that you have written down. What differentiates between them? In other words, what makes one of them a `dna`, one of them a `protein`, and one of them `other`? Write this down in three \"if... then...\" statements. This is the first draft of your *approach*.\n",
    "   2. It is important to critically examine your approach, and modify it if necessary. Consider the following 5 examples. Use your \"if... then...\" statements to determine if they are `dna`, `protein`, or `other`.\n",
    "      \n",
    "         ```python\n",
    "         str_1 = 'acgt'\n",
    "         str_2 = 'acgtd'\n",
    "         str_3 = 'acgtdj'\n",
    "         str_4 = 'AnApple'\n",
    "         str_5 = 'An Apple'\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "   3. Remember that in programming, you are basically giving instructions one step at a time. This means that the order of the steps is very important. Examine your three \"if... then...\" statements. Is the order of the three statement logical? If not, fix the order. You may also need to modify your \"if... then...\" statements.\n",
    "   4. Did you notice that it is very important to know what letters are symbols for nucleotides, and what letters are symbols for amino acids? Why is this? Let's collect the nucleotides and amino acids into two lists.\n",
    "        \n",
    "         ```python\n",
    "         nucleotide_list = ['a', 'c', 'g', 't', 'n']\n",
    "         aa_modified_list = ['b', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'h', 'i', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "   5. Notice that in the two lists above, we are placing the letters 'a', 'c', 'g', 't', and 'n' *only* in `nucleotide_list`, but *not* in the `aa_modified_list` (this is why we called this list the 'aa modified list', instead of just 'amino acid list'). Why are we doing this? How will it help us later?   \n",
    "   6. Next, recall what you've learned about the `in` operator in Chapter 2. For example, if you want to ask whether the letter `j` is in `nucleotide_list`, how would you code this? If you want to ask whether the letter `j` is in `aa_modified_list`, how would you code this?\n",
    "   7. Recall what you've leared about loops in Chapter 4. If you want to consider each individual letter in a string (e.g. `acgtdj`), one at a time, how would you code this? Combine this with your code from the previous step: consider the letters in a string one at a time, and for each letter ask whether it is in `nucleotide_list` and whether it is in `aa_modified_list`. \n",
    "   8. Recall what you've learned about conditionals in Chapter 3. How can you use conditionals to convert your \"if... then...\" statements into code? Combine this with your code from the previous step.\n",
    "   9. Test what you have written with the three examples that you have written down in the previous section, and with the 5 examples given above. Did your code correctly classify each example into `dna`, `protein`, or `other`? If not, what went wrong? Isolate the issue and examine the logic behind your approach. Review what you have learned in previous chapters, and critically examine your code for any errors.\n",

    "   If you have not done so already, convert your code into a function. Read the complete text of the exercise again. Does your code satisfy everything that the exercise asks for? \n",
    "   \n",
    "   You can now test your function with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   test_str_1 = \"FNEFDKRYAQGKGFITMALNSCHTSSLPTPEDKEQAQQTHHEVLMSLILGLLRSWNDPL\"\n",
