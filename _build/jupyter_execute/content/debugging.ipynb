    "The purpose of the code in this notebook is to count how often each TF in the network is a target of a TF in the network (it also counts if a TF regulates itself).\n",
    "In other words, how many TFs in the network bind in the promoter of a given TF.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple *bugs* in the code. Some are obvious mistakes (e.g. typos) that can lead to runtime errors. However, some are mistakes that do not produce runtime errors, but produce an incorrect output.\n",
    "The goal is to *debug* the code so that it runs without errors, and produces the correct output.\n",

    "**Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the purpose of this code? (This should be obvious from the short description given above and the code itself)\n",
    "2. What is the input and what is the expected output? \n",
    "**Answer this question before running or changing the code, but make use of the network as defined in the dictionary `hsc_network`**.\n",
    "3. Identify the source of the runtime errors, and fix the mistake into the code so that the script runs without error. \n",
    "In that case, the last line of the output should be \"Finished analysis of HSC network\".\n",
    "4. After you fixed the errors in the code, does the code produce the expected output? \n",
    "5. What is the output (list each TF and its target frequency)?\n",
    "6. How would you solve this counting problem more elegantly? Hint: e.g. by using a single dictionary to replace the list `list_of_tfs` and dictionary `tf_to_index`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advice: make liberal use of `print()` statements to understand \n",
    "1. What each line in the code is trying to achieve\n",
    "2. How to make the code function correctly, and make sure that it indeed functions correctly."

    "1. This script contains a bug (otherwise it wouldn't be a question here). Can you identify the bug without running the code (try for at least 10 minutes)?\n",
    "2. Run the code as it is given. Does the code provide the correct output for the TF named 'Scl'?\n",
    "4. Change the variable \"my_tf_of_interest\" to different TFs in the dictionary `hsc_network`. Does the code provide the correct output for all TFs? \n",

    "For instance, you can use an `if` statement to check the length of a list, or whether a key is present in the dictionary.\n",
    "1. Add `print()` statements to understand what each line is doing and what the value is of a variable.\n",
